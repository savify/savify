## 1. Definitions

> TPP - third-party provider. External service that is integrated by Savify. Provides data about accounts, balances and
> transactions for users that connected their bank with account.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization 

The main business entity is a `User`. To be a `User`, `User Registration` is required and should be confirmed. `User`
can be registered by providing basic information - name, email and password. Additionally, `User` can be registered with
Apple or Google authentication.

`User`'s email address should be unique within the application.

During `User Registration` with email/password, `Confirmation Code` should be generated and sent to provided email address.
`User Registration` should be confirmed using sent `Confirmation Code` (by typing it or by scanning QR code).

When `User` forgot his password, he can reset it. Email with `Confirmation Code` should be sent to `User`, and after 
confirming password reset action, `User` can set new password.

Each `User` has assigned one or more `User Role`. Base `User Roles` are `Administrator` and `User`, but role list can 
be extended in the future.

Each `User Role` has a set of `User Permission`. `User Permission` defines whether `User` can invoke a particular action.

`User` can authenticate to the application using registered email/password or one of other authentication methods 
(Google/Apple). For authentication JTW Token is used.

Each `User` has right to delete his application account with all data related to this account. Due to GDPR requirements,
after `User`'s account deletion Savify can store only statistical data, all the personal data should be soft/hard deleted.

## 3. Accounts

- Title
- `Account Type`
- `Currency`
- Balance
- is included in total balance
- view metadata
  - icon
  - color

`Account Type` can be one of: `Cash`, `Debit`, `Credit`, `Investment`, `Crypto`.

`Account Types` specifications:

1. `Cash`
   - does not have ability to integrate with bank

2. `Debit`
   - is a standard account type with standard behavior
   - has IBAN/BBAN field

3. `Credit`
   - instead of balance hase two properties - credit limit and available balance. Credit limit can not be accessed through
     TPP, so it should be set manually by user.
   - optionally, `User` can set credit card billing cycle, so app will notify about needed paybacks

4. `Investment`
   - have a list of stocks/indexes/ETF's that `User` invested in. Each position has its symbol, purchase date and quantity.
   - data about current price will be fetched through financial data TPP.

5. `Crypto`
   -  have a list of cryptocurrencies. Each position has its symbol, purchase date and purchase price.

`User` can add new `Accounts`, modify existing `Accounts`, modify balances (only for `Cash`, `Debit` and `Credit` `Accounts` that are 
not connected to the bank), hide `Accounts` and delete them.

### 3.2. Connecting accounts to banks

`Users` can connect their bank accounts to `Accounts` with `Debit` or `Credit` account types. Each `Account` can have only
one bank connection.

`User` cannot modify balance, IBAN/BBAN, currency on`Accounts` with bank connection. All this data will be fetched automatically
through **TPP**.

`User` can disconnect his bank from `Account` at any time.

When bank is connected to `Account`, balances and transactions will be fetched automatically when user accesses the application.

## 4. Transactions

Each `Account` has a list of `Transactions`. `Transaction` has one of types: `Expense`, `Income`, `Transfer`, `Debt` and `Goal`.

`Transaction` has information about source, destination, date, amount and various of information including description and
tags. `Transaction` can be connected to other `Transaction` to ensure that it was `Transfer` between different `Accounts`.
`Transaction` can be splitted, so the part of it can be treated as `Debt`.

### 4.1. Incomes

It can be added manually or automatically with bank connection mechanism.

### 4.2. Expenses

and `Income` and identifying them as transfers between accounts.

### 4.3. Debt

`Debt` can be created when `User` don't want to identify `Transaction` as `Expense` or `Income`. With `Debt` mechanism,
transaction can be treated as `User`'s or someone else's debt. `Debt` can be added manually or automatically identified 
from transaction that was performed from `User`'s `Account` to IBAN that is saved in system and is identifying as e.g. 
`User`'s friend. More about `Debts` is described in [7. Debt Management](#7-Debt-Management) section.

that will be identified as a `Goal`, so the certain amount from `Account` with a `Goal` will be "frozen". More about `Goals`
is described in [8. Goals](#8-Goals) section.

## 5. Categories

Each `Transaction` can have a `Category`. There are 9 main `Categories`, each of main categories has a set of subcategories.
`Categories` can be set automatically by categorization mechanisms or manually by `User`. `User` has ability to change 
categories that were defined automatically. 

## 6. Budget Planning

`User` has ability to plan his budget for each `Expense` `Category` or for overall spending. `Budgets` can be set for a 
specific time period (e.g. monthly, yearly). Savify provides visual representations to track budget progress and send 
notifications when nearing or exceeding budget limits.

## 7. Debt Management

reminders for repayment. `Debt` can be added manually or automatically identified from transaction that was performed 
from `User`'s `Account` to IBAN that is saved in system and is identifying as e.g. `User`'s friend.

## 8. Goals

`User` can set financial `Goals` such as saving for a vacation, purchasing a car, or paying off a debt. `Goals` can have 
target amounts, deadlines, and tracking mechanisms to monitor progress. Savify should provide visual representations 
and notifications to keep users motivated.

## 9. Statistics Analysis

budgeting tips, expenses/incomes overview, investment strategies, and debt management advice.
